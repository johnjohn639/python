# python
Given a list of integers, say MyList, and a special value, say SpecialValue, write a function called FindValue that returns the index of the first occurrence of the special value in the list or else returns â€“1 if the list does not contain the special value. Insert a comment in your program to explain why you cannot simply write: return MyList.index(SpecialValue). Include a main program the calls the function two times: once when SpecialValue is in MyList and once when SpecialValue is not in MyList
